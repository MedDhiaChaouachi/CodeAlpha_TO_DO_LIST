# To-Do List Web App

This is a simple and interactive To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during my web development internship with CodeAlpha. The web app allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks and organizes them into different categories such as "All", "Pending", and "Completed" tasks.

## Features:

Add Tasks: Users can input new tasks, and they will be added to the list of tasks.
Edit Tasks: Users can modify the tasks they have already added.
Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list.
Task Categories:
All: Displays all tasks.
Pending: Shows only the incomplete tasks.
Completed: Displays only the completed tasks.
